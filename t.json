To help the village grow and flourish, it is imperative to gather essential resources such as wood and stone.\n\nWood is needed for constructing the basic framework of the village buildings, including houses for the settlers, workshops for craftsmen, and storage facilities for supplies. It will also be used to build sturdy fences to protect the village from wild animals and to create pathways that make movement around the settlement safer and easier. The wooden structures will serve as the foundation upon which the village's future is built.\n    \nStone, on the other hand, is vital for creating strong and durable foundations for the buildings. It will be used to pave roads, ensuring that the village remains accessible even during adverse weather conditions. Additionally, stone is crucial for constructing fireplaces and ovens, which will provide warmth and means for cooking food, essential for the villagers' survival and comfort.","type":0,"reward":[{"i":"GoldCoin","q":100},{"i":"Water","q":30},{"i":"Wheat","q":30},{"i":"Potato","q":10}],"itemsCollect":[{"i":"Wood","q":50},{"i":"Stone","q":50}]},{"namespace":"QuestFeedingTheVillage","completed":false,"progress":0,"fav":false,"name":"Feeding The Village","description":"The construction of the village requires a lot of physical effort from the workers.
